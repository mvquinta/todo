# 1+Todo

Todo List Project made following The Odin Project learning path.

Main features:
- Add/Del tasks and projects
- Set a due date
- 3 levels of priority
- Check and uncheck tasks

Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the UI I followed Todoist, an app I use myself.
Data is saved using localStorage

In all I learned I would highlight two different skills: 
- "how to think and plan" the app
- dealing with objects and arrays


//////////////////////////////

For a future update I would like to add the possibility to edit the task, make my app web responsive and use something like firebase to save data.
I'm happy with the final result and aware of the things I can make in the near future to make it better.
